# sql-structure
>Development of database structures addressing concepts and practices related to MySQL for the design of "ER diagram" (Entity-Relationship diagram).

## Getting started

### Inicialize the project
1. Installs dependencies and compiles the TypeScript project.

```bash
npm run start
```

2. Launches and starts all the services defined in the Docker Compose configuration file:

```bash
npm run docker
```


### Insert data from javascript to mysql
1. Install MySQL Server: 
* Download and install MySQL Server from the official MySQL website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

2. Start the MySQL Server:
* On Unix-like systems, you can usually start the service using a command like sudo service mysql start.
* On Windows, you can start the service from the Services app or using the command prompt.

3. Create a MySQL Database:
```bash
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
```
4. Install mysql2 Package:
```bash
npm install mysql2
```
5. Connect to MySQL Database:
```ts
import mysql from 'mysql2';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config()

const poolOptical = mysql.createPool({
  host: process.env.MYSQL_HOST,
  user: process.env.MYSQL_USER,
  password: process.env.MYSQL_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.MYSQL_DATABASE,
  port: 3306 // same port to mysql server
});

export default poolOptical
```
6. Run application:
```bash
npm run inserts-optical
```

## Schemas

### Level 1 - Optical Store

The repository models the management of an optician. Here are the key points summarized:

| **Entities** | **Atributes**                                                                                                                 |
| -------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suppliers    | Name, address, phone, fax, TIN.                                                                                               |
| Glasses      | Brand, prescription, frame type, frame and lens color, price.                                                                 |
| Customers    | Name, address, phone, email, registration date. When registering a new customer, store who recommended them.                  |
| Sales        | Sales	Register the employee who made the sale and define a time period.                                                      |

>[!NOTE]
>To perform these verifications, you can find the query scripts in the directory src/optical_store/scripts. Refer to these scripts to verify that the design is correct.

**Optics Verification Queries:** 

1. List the total purchases of a customer.
2. List the different glasses sold by an employee during a year.
3. List the different suppliers who have supplied glasses successfully sold for the optician.
